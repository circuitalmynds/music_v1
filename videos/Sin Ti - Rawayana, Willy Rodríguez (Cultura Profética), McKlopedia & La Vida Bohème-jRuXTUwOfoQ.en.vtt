00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:10.040
♫♪

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.320
I can't even eat

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.840
is that I can't forget you

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.640
oh life mine, help me

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.460
without you I can't live anymore

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.380
and I am still like this

00:00:47.055 --> 00:00:49.595
without your love

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.260
and I am still like this

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.620
is that my life without you...

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.440

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.720
I have to get on my knees

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:04.920
and pray

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.440
(so tough, so tough, so tough, so tough)

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.540
Oh baby it's not enoug (enough, enough)

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.780
oh baby it's not enough (enough, enough)

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.060
I have to get on my knees

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.140
and pray (enough, enough, enough, enough)

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.360

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.720
Everything is forgotten now

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.060
tears in our altar

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.280

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.300
you are my soulmate

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.880
without you I can't breathe

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.560
and I am still like this

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.240
without your smell

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.520
and I am still like this

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.320
is that my life without you...

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.660
I can't live... Nooo...

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.860
(so tough, so tough, so tough, so tough)

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.140
I have to get on my knees

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.220
and pray

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.000
(so tough, so tough, so tough, so tough)

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.060
oh ooohhh

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.840
Oh baby it's not enough

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:18.920
(enough, enough)

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.140
Oh baby it's not enough (enough, enough)

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.600
I have to get on my knees

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.480
and pray (enough, enough, enough, enough)

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.500
If I can't sleep, can't breathe

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.280
and I don't stop thinking that the days without you, without your body,

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.160
is like a mission of endless torture

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.040
...why do I want to exist?

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.020
...why do you leave me like that... without you?

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.940
if you are the light of my eyes, reason for my being, you were born for me

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.520
I didn't think you were like that

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.780
but from then and when I met you, my heart started to beat

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.560
I could not lie to you

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.680
I could never pretend

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.480
you're all good in me

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.880
is that my life is very sad without you...

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.460
and I am still like this

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.400
without your love

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.680

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.300

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.900
I can't live... Nooo...

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.680
(so tough, so tough, so tough, so tough)

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.380
Come rock steady debe doo va day

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.940

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.240
(enough, enough, enough, enough)

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.240
I have to go...

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.820
And I don't want to walk away

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.760
Oh life mine, help me...
