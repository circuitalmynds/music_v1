Creedence Clearwater Revival is undeniably one of the greatest rock bands of all time, with an instantly recognizable, raw, bayou sound, popularized in songs like "Proud Mary" and "Green River‚Äù. Since their formation in the 1960s, CCR has sold over 50 million records, while their songs remain in heavy rotation on the radio. 

Though the band only released 7 studio albums in their too-short career,  Creedence had an astonishing track record: eight consecutive gold singles ("Proud Mary," "Bad Moon Rising," "Green River," "Down on the Corner," "Who'll Stop the Rain," "Up Around the Bend," "Lookin' Out My Back Door," "Have You Ever Seen the Rain?") and eight consecutive gold albums. With music that sounds as fresh and compelling today as it did 30 years ago, CCR is one of a handful of bands whose entire body of work has attained true "classic" status.
